# We start with _ioslides_

## The basics | `output: ioslides_presentation`

- For details and more options see [The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/ioslides-presentation.html)

- Remember that you can insert code chunks in all formats.

- YAML info constitutes the first main slide.

- Two hashes and a title (`## The basics of slides`) create a new slide (like the one you're reading now)

- Single hash creates a section slide (`# Section 1`)

# Section 1

## Sections... | they have subtitles sometimes

Adding a pipe `|` symbol in the slide title allows you to create subtitles.

e.g. `Sections... | they have subtitles sometimes`

## Display modes

ioslides provides several shortcuts for handy display modes.

- `f` - fullscreen mode
- `w` - widescreen mode
- `o` - overview mode
- `h` - code highlight mode (I'm not sure what that's supposed to do...)
- `p` - show presenter notes

## Incremental bullets

> - Use `incremental: true` option in YAML to have the bullet points appear one by one.

> - Alternatively, you can do this only for a specific list.

> - to achieve this, write "`> -`" instead of just "`-`"

## Manipulating the presentation size {.smaller}

- Use "`widescreen: true`" to toggle widescreen on by default.

- Use "`smaller: true`" to keep the font size small.

- Alternatively, you can put "`{.smaller}`" right after your slide header to apply this only locally (like in this slide)

## Other options worth mentioning: {.smaller .build data-background=img/background.jpg}

- "`transition: slower/faster/_numeric value_`" to modify slide transitions.

- "`{.build}`" after a slide header, to make the content appear gradually (like here).

- "`data-background:`" attribute to modify the background image ([photo source](https://www.pexels.com/photo/beach-2833563/))

- CSS styles still work ("`css: styles.css`")

- "`logo:` for a logo image" 

- <div class="blue2">Use html syntax with specific classes for more options, e.g. to color stuff</div> ("`<div class="red2"> text </div>`")

- You can add notes using "`<div class="notes">These are some hidden notes for the presenter (they can include MD as well)</div>`" and then view them using `p` or adding "`?presentme=true`" to the URL (try both to see the outcomes).

<div class="notes">These are some hidden notes for the presenter (they can include MD as well)</div>

## Slidy

[A `Slidy` presentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/slidy-presentation.html)

Let's modify the output to slidy and see what happens.

> - Lots of stuff stopped working.

> - But of course we have new options as well.

> - Press `c` for a table of contents

> - Press `f` to toggle the footer

> - Press `a` to display all slides one after another

> - Press `s` (**s**maller) or `b` (**b**igger) to change font size

> - We can also add stuff to the footer like the countdown clock, or info:

> - "`duration: 15`"

> - "`footer: "Presentation for the RR course."`"

## Beamer and Powerpoint

[A `Beamer` presentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/beamer-presentation.html)

Beamer uses LaTeX, so again you can use LaTeX syntax here.

- Some nice themes here, try:

`output:`  
`  beamer_presentation:`  
`    theme: "AnnArbor"`  
`    colortheme: "dolphin"`  
`    fonttheme: "structurebold"`
    
You can also check `powerpoint_presentation`
