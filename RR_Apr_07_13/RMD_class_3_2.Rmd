# Other output formats

We've briefly mentioned before other outputs such as PDF, Word, PowerPoint and html presentations. Different formats use different options.

[The cheatsheets have a nice reference table for that.](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf)

## PDF

**Important note**: You need a LaTeX distribution installed to create .pdf files with RMarkdown. You can find [a short instruction here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/install-latex.html). If you've never installed any LaTeX distribution, go ahead and do it now.

PDFs are created using LaTeX. We'll be talking a bit more about LaTeX, but for now we'll just give you an idea on how it can be combined with RMarkdown. 

Note: you might want to create a copy of the .Rmd file now, because we'll be changing it into a PDF document.

### PDF-specifc options

Changing the font size:

`fontsize: 11pt`

Changing the margins: 

`geometry: margin=1in`

(These actually modify LaTeX template options).

---

### LaTeX-related

We can set the document type.

`documentclass: article` 

(alternatives include `letter`, `book`, `slides`, `beamer`, etc.)

---

We can change the engine used to produce the output, e.g.:

`  pdf_document:`  
`    latex_engine: xelatex`

---

We can tell RMarkdown to keep the intermediate `.tex` file.

`  pdf_document:`  
`    keep_tex: true`

(Note: similarly, we can keep the `.md` file for non-pdf formats with `keep_md: true`)

---

We can use `LaTeX` directly within the document and it will be processed using the chosen engine.

`\newpage  `

\end{center}
\newpage  
\Large Large letters
\footnote{This is a footnote}

You may also use the LaTeX citation syntax. We need to specify what package do we want to use to manage the citations, e.g.:

`pdf_document:`  
`    citation_package: natbib`

`Studies concerning other cultural goods exploit quasi-natural experiments of policy and institutional changes. One example of the policy change is the introduction of download penalization in France (HADOPI), as scrutinized by \citet{danaher_effect_2012}. The analyzed cases of institutional change include the sudden and transitory disappearance of the NBC content from iTunes \citep[a case unrelated to unauthorized distribution, hence plausibly exogenous, see][]{danaher_converting_2010} as well as the Megaupload shutdown \citep{danaher_gone_2014,peukert_piracy_2013} and website blocking in the UK \citep{danaher_website_2016}. Interestingly, \citet{danaher_gone_2014} and \citet{peukert_piracy_2013} analyzing the same case of Megaupload shutdown come to rather different conclusions: the former find that the shutdown caused an increase in digital downloads from legal sources; the latter finds no change in box office revenue. This difference could be attributed to the fact that a downloaded "pirated" copy may be a perfect substitute for a copy downloaded from a legitimate source, but not for a visit to the movie theater.\footnote{The two studies  differ also methodologically and in the sample used: \citet{danaher_gone_2014} covering 12 countries \citet{peukert_piracy_2013} as many as 50 countries.} \citet{danaher_website_2016} argue that only large scale interventions (such as blocking multiple websites with unauthorized distribution) appear noticeably reduce "piracy" and raise paid consumption, but these effects are only transitory.`
