## Reproducible Environment

We have previously learned how to store our codes, data, documentation using version control. This allows us to go back to any of the previous versions of what we've created at any given moment.

However, our codes depend on other variables like package and R versions. Not keeping track of the environment can get us into trouble:

1) Old code might not work.

2) Colleagues unable to achieve the same results despite (seemingly) using the same code.

You can find some staggering examples [here](http://datacolada.org/95).

For full reproducibility we need to either use a fixed environment (one that anyone can access), or have a jointly managed environment (e.g. by admins in a firm), or be able to record what we're using and share it with others.

[Read more about the basic ideas.](https://environments.rstudio.com/)

Sometimes Session Info is all we need:

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

Here's an easy way to save it among your project files:
```{r}
sink(file="session_info.txt")
sessionInfo()
sink()
```
In Python, a more elaborate way of handling this could be [through `requirements.txt`](https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-pip-install-requirements/).


## In other cases: [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html)

`renv` is the R package for reproducible environments (check [`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) or [`pipenv`](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) for pretty much the same stuff in Python; also [managing environments in Conda](https://towardsdatascience.com/reproducible-data-science-with-conda-48f9de6eabd5)). 

Normally, R looks for the most recent packages in its core folder:

```{r}
.libPaths()
```

Let's initialise a reproducible environment setting though:

```{r}
renv::init()
```

You can then take a look at the new folder `renv` and `renv.lock` file.

### What's going on

`renv` creates a library set that is specific for our project. In terms of how it works later on, it tells R to first look for packages in this new folder, and only then globally:

```{r}
.libPaths()
```

And we store different versions of packages here than we do globally.

### What if we upgrade something?

Let's find us an out-of-date package:

```{r}
View(old.packages())
```

```{r}
# install.packages("highr")
```

Take a look at the contents of `renv.lock`. Let's update this.

```{r}
renv::snapshot()
```

Great! But what if our code broke after the update? 

### Reverting environments

The `renv` package can take a look at the Git version control system that stores previous commits. We can use it to revert to a prior version of `renv.lock`.

```{r}
renv::history()
```

```{r}
renv::revert(commit = "dcd2eae4220e41d40e5e9e54f6bf453af9dbc9e1")
```

Let's see what happened:

```{r}
renv::status()
```

We have a new version of the package but the lockfile uses an older one. Let's restore it.

```{r}
renv::restore()
```

There are other functions in the package that you can check out. For one, `renv` was partially meant as a replacement to another reproducible environment package `packrat`. You can actually use `renv::migrate()` to convert rep. env. from `packrat` to a `renv` format.

## A less 'overkill' approach is to use the new [`groundhog`](http://datacolada.org/95) package (also check [here](https://groundhogr.com/))

![Well it's groundhog day... again](groundhog.jpg)

```{r}
 install.packages("groundhog")
```

So previously we did this:
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
```

And now we can, instead, do this:
```{r}
library("groundhog")
pkgs <- c("rvest", "stringi")
groundhog.library(pkgs, date = "2021-09-01")
```
And `groundhog` will pick the most recent versions of packages that existed at that date.

The advantages:
- It's really easy to retrofit your older code (just change the library loading lines)
- You finish a project, enter a date to library loading, and it should make it robust for a long time
- `groundhog` just downloads and installs the appropriate versions without replacing the newer ones
- if they're already there, it just loads up the appropriate one.
- it also installs dependencies from that date.
- no additional files and no project needed! You just include the necessary information in the code file (and anyone can easily check what that is).
